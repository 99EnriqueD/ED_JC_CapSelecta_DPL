# The coin-urn experiment

This experiment was made to show combined:

* Probabilistic inference
* Learning probabilistic parameters
* Deep Learning

The data was generated using the ``generate_data.py`` script. Coin are represented by MNIST digits, even and odd replacing heads and tails. The balls are given as RGB triplets that are the base colours that have been shifted in the HSV domain with gaussian noise.

```bash
python run.py
```
